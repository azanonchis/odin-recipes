  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>If you have ever wanted to make Japanese noodle house ramen, this tonkatsu recipe is for you. This everyday meal is
    great for singles with some cooking experience; it may take longer than the overall time without cooking experience.
    To save time, I rarely measure each ingredient's amount due to the large number of small measurements in the recipe.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons spicy sesame oil</li>
    <li>2 (1x3-inch) boneless pork chop slices</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, divided</li>
    <li>2 leaves fresh basil, chopped, divided</li>
    <li>1 leaf fresh sage, chopped, divided</li>
    <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles (such as Shirakiku®), seasoning packet discarded</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons shredded dried kombu</li>
    <li>1 ¾ tablespoons bonito soup stock (such as Hondashi®)</li>
    <li>1 ¾ tablespoons soy sauce (shoyu)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Toppings:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 1/3-inch slices fish paste stick (naruto)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tonkatsu sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sushi ginger (shoga), finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain.
      Run cold water over egg and set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2
      tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with these remaining
      ingredients: 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.</li>
    <li>Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue
      cooking until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain
      in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.</li>
    <li>Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium
      heat, until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.</li>
    <li>Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish with
      tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <p>You can find most of the ingredients in a Japanese market.</p>
  <p>You can substitute dried Welsh onions for green onions. You can substitute dried basil and sage for fresh if
    preferred.</p>
  <p>Start preparing pork while waiting for the water to boil for the egg so everything is finished by the time the egg
    is cooked and cooled.</p>
