  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Fresh chunks of tuna, ripe mango, and creamy avocado combine to make the perfect appetizer or a tasty lunch. I love
    to eat this with lime-seasoned tortilla chips, but it's just as delicious served in lettuce cups. I try to keep the
    tuna, avocado and mango pieces between 1/4- and 1/2-inch in size. Best eaten same-day, but can be kept 1-2 days in
    fridge, keeping in mind that texture will change.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound sushi-grade tuna, diced</li>
    <li>½ cup diced avocado</li>
    <li>½ cup diced mango</li>
    <li>¼ cup minced red onion</li>
    <li>¼ cup minced cilantro</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced jalapeno pepper</li>
    <li>⅓ cup fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine tuna, avocado, mango, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeno in a bowl. Drizzle with lime juice and oil and
      season with salt and pepper. Gently toss to coat evenly. Refrigerate for 1 hour, gently tossing halfway through.
    </li>
  </ol>
